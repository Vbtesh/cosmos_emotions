    "> Your job is now to tell the seller (your friend) how much you’d be willing to pay for the painting, given how much you think it’ll go for at auction tomorrow. You might model this as a simple point estimate (the painting is worth $10,000) or as a range, like a Gaussian, where you tell them the mean and variance (I think it’ll go for \\$10,000, but +/- \\$1K). \n",

    "How surprised / disappointed your friend feels by how this sale reflects on their actual, internal estimate of the painting. This is where the ‘plausible deniability’ aspect comes into account – if you tell them a very wide range, its possible that (a) you think that the painting could be worth a lot, but (b) they could just seem to have a ‘fluke’ bad day tomorrow – saving face as to how much the painting really was worth.\n"
