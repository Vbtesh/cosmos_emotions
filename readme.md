# Project 9 Cosmos 2025: Empathetic Expectation Management

This repository contains the code for the project "Intervening on the emotions of others" for the 2025 Cosmos summer school. The project explores how an auctioneer's asked to appraise a painting may choose to adjust their evaluation of the art piece to try and protect the feelings of the painter.
